 * Definition of class Loris::BlockOscillator, a Bandwidth-Enhanced 
 * wavetable oscillator that uses a fixed block (frame) size (generates
 * the same number of samples every call, assumes uniform sampling of the
 * envelopes), and performs no bounds or aliasing checks (intended to be 
 * fast and cheap). The bandlimited noise modulator samples are provided 
 * for each block by the caller.
